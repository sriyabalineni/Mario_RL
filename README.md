# Mario_RL
We have added two folders called Mario_RightOnly and Mario_SimpleMovements.
# Mario_RightOnly
Mario_RightOnly consist of two folders called codes and checkpoints_train
  # codes
  codes folder consists of main.py and test_agent.py folders
   # main.py
   This is where training of the agent happens, one can load previously created checkpoint which would have saved model when starting main.pyest
   # test_agent.py
   test_agent.py is used to load the trained model to see how mario plays
  # checkpoints_train
  checkpoints_train folder will contain saved models and the plots of average rewards and q values, this is what has to be loaded in the test_agent.py when testing   the agent
 # Mario_SimpleMovements
 The above mentioned implementation holds good for Mario_SimpleMovements too with only difference of using simple_movements unlike right_only action space
